build me a simple chrome extension that allows me to toggle the grayscale of my browser (on any website and tab) via slider. 

the extension should have a popup that allows me to toggle the grayscale filter on and off. 

the extension should have a popup that allows me to slide the grayscale filter from 0 to 100.
